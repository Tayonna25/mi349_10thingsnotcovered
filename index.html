    <h1>CSS Framework</h1>
    <p>As you know there was a time CSS was something that had to be started from scratch but 
        with the recent research I have done. I have learned that it doesn’t, your front-end development 
        could be started with Bootstrap and Tailwind. Things like Tailwind have a number of reviews of
         how wished they wouldv’e started using it sooner. Using Tailwind or Bootstrap can give you 
         defaults, rests, and components. It can give a modern day website feel. Using Tailwind you could 
         quickly build your websites without even ever leaving html. Tailwind automatically removes all 
         unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it 
         could possibly be. Most of Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client. 
         Tailwind can be installed with the CLI tool but it is possible to install it without Node.js. 
         Editor Setup you can use plugins and configuration settings can improve your developing experience working 
         in Tailwind css. When using tailwind css it uses alot of customs like @tailwind, @apply, @screen. When using Visual
         studio code there is a plugin called tailwind CSS IntelliSense it supports all of the custom @ rules and functions.
        IntellSense extension enhances tailwind development with autocomplete (class names), linting (it highlights errors
        in your css and markup) , and syntax highlighting (provide syntax definitions) . There is also a automatic class 
        sorting plugin called prettier. There is many things that can be learned about Tailwind but overall Tailwind is a 
        extremely useful tool to use with coding for websites. It make things faster, efficient, and less error prone.
